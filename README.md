## Analzying protocol price performance during on-chain attacks :star:!
In this project we will be investigating the Fortress Protocol hack that occured on May 9th, 2022. The lending and borrowing protocol endure an orale manipulation attack that resulted in $3,000,000 USD lost.

&nbsp;
## Purpose
I've had an interest in Web3 attacks since the Mt. Gox exchange hack :muscle:
I think exploring the Fortress Protocol debacle will give more clarity and insight on how we use safeguards, strategy, and execution to prevent events like these from happening.
