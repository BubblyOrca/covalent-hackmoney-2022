# Covalent Hackmoney 2022
Covalent API project for HackMoney 2022 by ETHGlobal

All templates use the Covalent API to pull on-chain data seamlessly from [supported blockchains](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/networks/).

## Analzying protocol price performance during on-chain attacks :star:!
In this project we will be investigating the ongoing Terra LUNA $UST depegging crisis that has significantly reduced the value of investors stablecoin stash. This is a pivotal time in alt-coin history because a stablecoin has depegged by > 50% overnight.

&nbsp;
## Purpose
I've had an interest in Web3 attacks since the Mt. Gox exchange hack :muscle:
I think exploring the $UST debacle will give more clarity and insight on how we use safeguards, strategy, and execution to prevent events like these from happening.
